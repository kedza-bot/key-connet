    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
        My web app helps people connect for learning, sharing useful information, posting jobs, 
        and most importantly — connecting with others. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem I’m solving is that it’s hard for junior developers like me to connect with senior developers. 
        With this app, I make it possible for dreamers to access free resources and opportunities to become 
        whatever they want to be — all without subscription fees.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using blogs within the app, anyone can share knowledge, learn new skills, and inspire others. 
        My mission is to create a better Africa for Africans — showing that we can build and use 
        technology just as effectively as anywhere else in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve already built an MVP that’s live and running, and I’m proud to say I entered the 
        FNB App Academy competition using the skills I gained from the academy. 
        Shoutout to IT Varsity and Skillseeker Hub — a must-visit place for web developers on TikTok.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Aim</h2>
    <p>
        To bridge the gap between aspiring developers and experienced professionals, 
        fostering a culture of free learning, sharing, and collaboration.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Motto</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>LOTS</strong> — Listen more, Observe, Try it, Simplify it.
    </p>
